                content: "Here we will talk about how the Setup page was created\nList linkFor the list part, it’s simple, just put the character “-” before the sentence and the list will be formed:\n- git\r- Go ≥ v1.19\r- Hugo ≥ v0.117.0 (Extended Version) Tags linkIn sections 2.1 and 3, short code labels were used. These tags make it possible to create a menu that offers different information on the same topic. In our case, we use short code labels to present the different ways to automatically install Lotus Docs on different operating systems. This way, users no longer need to search for installation instructions specific to their operating system; just access the corresponding section and select your operating system.\nTo use tags, you must start by opening the tab using {{ \u003c tabs tabTotal=\"n\" \u003e }}, where “n” corresponds to the number of divisions required. For example, on the configuration page, we set “n” to 4 for section 2.1 and 3 for section 3. Next, we need to define the tab name using the code {{ % tab tabName=\"Linux\" % }}, and then you can insert the content of the tab. To finish dividing the tab, use {{ %/tab % }}, and to close the entire tab section, use {{ }}.\n{{ \u003c tabs tabTotal=\"4\"\u003e }}\r{{ % tab tabName=\"Linux\" % }}\r## content...\r{{ % /tab % }}\r## more tabs...\r{{ \u003c /tabs \u003e }}\rHighlights and Emphasis linkWhen writing texts, it is sometimes important to highlights specific parts so that users can better understand the key points of the sentences, such as important commands or codes. To do this, simply place the grave accent (``) at the beginning and end of the words you want to highlights.\nAnother way is to use asterisks (**), both before and after the words, making them bold and emphasize the sentence.\nExamples of how this was used on the ‘Setup’ page:\n...\rTo build second level menu items, first create a directory called **\"parent\"** that has a file called ``_index.md``. For example:\r...\rIn this example, asterisks were used to emphasize the word “parent”, while grave accents were used to highlight a file.\nLinks linkDuring the process of creating the “Setup” page, it was also necessary to create links, both external and internal. For external links, the following code was used: [Word that will contain the link](URL of the external site). While for internal links, for example, this code was used: [Word that will contain the link](\\docs\\deployment).\nLines of codes and commands linkTo differentiate code lines or commands and highlight them for users, we chose to use shell and the prism shortcode.\nShell linkShell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system via text. We used shell to indicate that these lines can be used as commands or code. An example used on the Setup page is:\n```shell\rbrew install hugo\r```\rThis allows users to copy this line and paste it into their Linux terminals to install Hugo.\nPrism linkPrism is a shortcode that highlights lines of code intended for text languages like Markdown and HTML. In the creation of the Setup page, prism was used to avoid conflicts between commands.

By hosting images on Sirv, we are able to improve the site’s performance, as there’s no need to render the images; Sirv does that for us, resulting in just displaying the images in our documentation.\nHere’s an example of how to display the image in the documentation:\n![Preview Site Publish](https://paulorodrigues-isep.sirv.com/TECAA/Preview_Site_Publish.png) The title of the image is within brackets [], while the image URL is within parentheses ().\nOn Sirv, simply upload the image and then copy the link:\nSirv also offers image customization options, such as size, to improve site performance.\nTreeview linkFurthermore, treeviews were used in section 8. This is because the discussion about directories was addressed there, and treeviews are the best option for representing directory hierarchies. With them, it’s possible to create a hierarchical view of folders, showing users how their files are organized in the end.\nIn section 8.1, the treeview was presented as follows:\n```treeview\rcontent/\r└── docs/\r├── parent-directory/\r│ └── _index.md\r├── new-page.md\r├── new-page-2.md\r├── setup.md\r└── _index.md\r```\rThis way, it was possible to show how the directory would look after creating a second level of folders.\n"

These tags make it possible to create a menu that offers different information on the same topic. In our case, we use short code labels to present the different ways to automatically install Lotus Docs on different operating systems. This way, users no longer need to search for installation instructions specific to their operating system; just access the corresponding section and select your operating system.\nTo use tags, you must start by opening the tab using {{ \u003c tabs tabTotal=\"n\" \u003e }}, where “n” corresponds to the number of divisions required. For example, on the configuration page, we set “n” to 4 for section 2.1 and 3 for section 3. Next, we need to define the tab name using the code {{ % tab tabName=\"Linux\" % }}, and then you can insert the content of the tab. To finish dividing the tab, use {{ %/tab % }}, and to close the entire tab section, use {{ }}.\n{{ \u003c tabs tabTotal=\"4\"\u003e }}\r{{ % tab tabName=\"Linux\" % }}\r## content...\r{{ % /tab % }}\r## more tabs...\r{{ \u003c /tabs \u003e }}\rHighlights and Emphasis linkWhen writing texts, it is sometimes important to highlights specific parts so that users can better understand the key points of the sentences, such as important commands or codes. To do this, simply place the grave accent (``) at the beginning and end of the words you want to highlights.\nAnother way is to use asterisks (**), both before and after the words, making them bold and emphasize the sentence.\nExamples of how this was used on the ‘Setup’ page:\n...\rTo build second level menu items, first create a directory called **\"parent\"** that has a file called ``_index.md``. For example:\r...\rIn this example, asterisks were used to emphasize the word “parent”, while grave accents were used to highlight a file.\nLinks linkDuring the process of creating the “Setup” page, it was also necessary to create links, both external and internal. For external links, the following code was used: [Word that will contain the link](URL of the external site). While for internal links, for example, this code was used: [Word that will contain the link](\\docs\\deployment).\nLines of codes and commands linkTo differentiate code lines or commands and highlight them for users, we chose to use shell and the prism shortcode.\nShell linkShell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with an operating system via text. We used shell to indicate that these lines can be used as commands or code. An example used on the Setup page is:\n```shell\rbrew install hugo\r```\rThis allows users to copy this line and paste it into their Linux terminals to install Hugo.\nPrism linkPrism is a shortcode that highlights lines of code intended for text languages like Markdown and HTML. In the creation of the Setup page, prism was used to avoid conflicts between commands. For example, when a snippet contained a shell command within another, we opted to use prism to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.\nExample of using prism:\n{{ \u003c prism lang=\"md\" \u003e }}\r---\rweight: 200\rtitle: \"New Page\"\ricon: \"article\"\rdate: \"2024-04-17T18:19:36Z\"\rlastmod: \"2024-04-17T18:19:36Z\"\rdescription: \"This new page has the Lotus Documents theme\"\rdraft: true toc: true\rpublishdate: \"2023-05-03T22:37:22+01:00\"\rtags: [\"Beginners\"]\r---\r## Create New Content\rNavigate to the root of your Hugo project and use the `hugo new` command to create a file in the `content/docs` directory:\r```shell\rhugo new docs/examplepage.md\r```\r...\r{{ \u003c /prism \u003e }}\rAlerts linkTo highlight some important notes in the documentation, we used the Alert shortcode, as it allowed the creation of text boxes with different appearances.

                content: " 💡 A quick and basic guide to personalizing your documentation site with the Theme Lotus Docs to better suit your needs. Requirements linkBefore you begin customizing your Hugo documentation site, it is essential to have a basic understanding of the following:\nHTML CSS Markdown Text Personalization linkTo create your page, you will likely use basic highlighting mechanisms for your text.\nYou might want to create a header, and for that, you need to use the following code:\n# Heading To define other more minor headings, you’ll write the following:\n## Heading2\r### Heading3\r#### Heading4\r##### Heading5 The more # on the left of your text, the lower the level of the header.\nThere are two ways of adding bold text: bold text or bold text. You can’t see the difference when rendered, but it’s done as follows:\n**this** way or __this__ way In the same way, Italic text can also be done in two ways\n*this* way or _this_ way Additionally, you might need to add a strikethrough to the text, and for that, the code is as follows:\n~~strikethrough~~ To add links, use square brackets [] to display the text and the URL between the parenthesis.\nFor example, you might need to add a Youtube link, and to do this, you need to add the following code:\n[Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/) Adding images is very similar to the way we implement the URLs.\nJust use a ! before the square brackets [] and add the link to the image between the parenthesis.\n![Printscreen LandingPage](https://tania1998.sirv.com/images_tecaa/lotusdocs_hero.webp) Alerts linkAlerts are typically used to display information in a highlighted manner. Lotus Docs support `Alerts with context, Alerts with custom Emoji Icons, Alerts with No Icons and the possibility to render Markdown and HTML inside an Alert.\nAlerts with Context linkThe CONTEXT can be info, success, danger, warning, primary, light, and dark. To implement one alert, add the following code between {{double curly brackets }}\n\u003c alert context=\"context\" text=\"This is an Alert with an emoji with the success context.\" /\u003e To use the different alert contexts, change the context value for each one of the following:\nalert context= \"info\" info Info alert context alert context= \"success\" check_circle Success alert context alert context= \"danger\" report Danger alert context alert context= \"warning\" warning Warning alert context alert context= \"primary\" info Primary alert context Note: When in dark mode, light and dark alerts are inverted.\nalert context= \"light\" Light alert context alert context= \"dark\" Dark alert context Alerts with custom Emoji Icon linkWhile still using the context parameter, you can change the Emoji icon on the left of the Alert text. You only need to Copy and Paste emojis from this Emoji website to get emojis.\n🤚🏻 This is an Alert with an emoji with the success context. To do this, add the following code between {{double curly brackets }}\n\u003c alert icon=\"🤚🏻\" context=\"success\" text=\"This is an Alert with an emoji with the success context.\" /\u003e Alerts with no Icon link To get an alert with no icon, only set the icon parameter to a space alert icon=\" \"\nAlert with no icon with the danger context! Render Markdown and HTML inside an Alert linkTo do this, ensure that in the hugo.toml configuration file, the parameter unsafe is set to true under the [markup.goldmark.renderer].\n[markup.goldmark.renderer]\runsafe = true Now, to render Markdowns and HTML inside and Alert, it is needed to pair shortcodes with % delimiters, as following:\n{{ alert icon=\"🎅🏼\" context=\"success\" }}\rThis ***paired shortcode*** alert contains a **markdown** list and header:\r#### My Christmas List:\r1. A doll\r2. Books\r3. Socks\rMerry Christmas!\r{{ /alert }} which results in:\n🎅🏼\nThis paired shortcode alert contains a markdown list and header:\nMy Christmas List link A doll Books Socks Merry Christmas!\nCore Site Options linkIcons linkAdd Icons to your Headings linkTo add icons to content titles, add to the hugo.toml file the following:\n[params.docs]\rtitleIcon = true The icon that shows as a prefix to the content title will be set according to the icon: definition at the top of the page. Each definition is related to an icon that can be seen in the Google Icon styles;\nAdd Icons to the sidebar linkTo add icons to the sidebar content titles, add to the hugo.toml file the following:\n[params.docs]\rsidebarIcons = true Accent color linkBy default, the Lotus Docs theme has a blue accent color. However, you can change the accent color. This color affects links, buttons, and icons. To do this, go to the hugo.toml file:\n[params.docs]\rthemeColor = \"color\" This color can be blue, green, red, yellow, emerald, cardinal, magenta, or cyan.\nblue green red yellow emerald cardinal magenta cyan Dark Mode linkBy default, the dark mode is set to false. To set it to true as default, go to the hugo.toml file:\n[params.docs]\rdarkMode = true Font changing linkA font is a set of characters with a specific style and size used for displaying text in a consistent manner, which can impact a website’s overall design and feel. The Lotus Docs website has, by default, three sets of fonts, sans_serif_font, secondary_font, and mono_font. To change the fonts, add the following code to the file hugo.toml :\n[params]\rsans_serif_font = \"Times New Roman\"\rsecondary_font = \"Calibri\"\rmono_font = \"Arial\" You can define another font in each parameter and see where each applies to the pages.\nAdd Google Fonts linkFor extra customization, you can use other fonts that can be found on the Google Fonts site\nTo add new fonts, you need to implement an array of fonts with the name of the fonts and the sizes to load. E.g. I want to load the Montserrat and Gluten fonts, in the weights 300 and 400 respectively.\nwarning Fonts have their unique set of weights, please confirm before loading fonts. in the hugo.toml file implement the following code:\n[params]\rgoogle_fonts = [[\"Montserrat\", \"300\"],[\"Gluten\", \"400\"]]\rsans_serif_font = \"Gluten\"\rsecondary_font = \"Montserrat\"\rmono_font = \"Arial\" That will change the Fonts from:\nDefault Fonts Customised fonts info It is possible to customize the fonts even further by editing the website’s HTML and CSS files. We invite you to explore this functionality on your own!. Syntax Highlighting linkTo enhance and personalize code blocks, you can use Syntax Highlighting. Its is possible to use Prism, which Lotus Docs supports or Chroma the Hugo’s built-in code highlighter. Prism is enabled by default using the param.docs.prism in the file hugo.toml. Chroma is enabled by setting in the file hugo.toml under [params.docs] the following: prism = false.\nWhen using fenced code blocks, enclosed by triple backticks, specify the code language next to the opening backticks, and the code will be automatically highlighted.\nBuy our new t-shirt!\rBUY\rResults link Prism Chroma Prism Highlight - Supports ≈ 290 languages, check website for more information.\n[params.docs]\rprism = true Chroma Highlight - Supports ≈ 200 languages, check website for more information.\n[params.docs]\rprism = false Personalize Prism Theme linkYou can also personalize the Prism theme by changing the prismTheme parameter under [params.docs] in the config files.\nFor example, in hugo.toml, you only need to:\nLotusdocs Solarized-light Twilight Lucario [params.docs]\rprismTheme = \"lotusdocs\" To get: [params.docs]\rprismTheme = \"solarized-light\" To get: [params.docs]\rprismTheme = \"twilight\" To get: [params.docs]\rprismTheme = \"lucario\" To get: Landing page Templates linkCurrently, when creating a website with the Lotus Docs template, the landing page of a Lotus Docs website has four sections you can scroll through. Each of the sections is one of four templates, and each has its own set of parameters for customization.\nHero Feature Grid Image + Text Image Compare The first template shown is the hero, a basic template with two sections. On the left text and Call To Action buttons and the right a image.\nThis Hero template can be configurable in 8 components, as illustrated below:\nA list of features with multiple rows in a 3-column grid. Each feature on the grid consists of an icon, title, and descriptive text.\nThis Feature Grid template can be configurable in 6 components, as illustrated below:\nSimilar to the Hero template, this third template displays two columns; it is a basic template with two sections that can display an image, descriptive text, lists, and Call to Action Buttons.\nThis Image and Text template can be configurable in 5 components, as illustrated below:\nThis last template utilizes the ImageCompareViewer library to display before and after images, using an auto-generated tab to slide between the image comparison sets.\nThis Image Compare template can be configurable in 5 components, as illustrated below:\nAdditional Resources link Lotus Docs Documentation "

Each slice represents a proportionate part of the whole data set, typically displayed as a percentage of the total. Pie charts are commonly used to visualize data distribution and show the relative size of different categories or components within a dataset.\n---\rtitle: Pets adopted by volunteers\r---\rpie\r\"Dogs\" : 386\r\"Cats\" : 85\r\"Rats\" : 15 Pie Chart Syntax linkDrawing a pie chart is really simple in mermaid.\nStart with pie keyword to begin the diagram showData to render the actual data values after the legend text.

Each axis represents a different dimension or variable, and the quadrants are defined by dividing the chart area into four equal sections.\nQuadrant charts are commonly used to analyze and visualize data relationships, particularly when comparing two sets of variables or criteria. They help identify patterns, trends, and outliers within the dataset, allowing users to categorize data points into different quadrants based on their positions relative to the axes\nquadrantChart\rtitle Reach and engagement of campaigns\rx-axis Low Reach --\u003e High Reach\ry-axis Low Engagement --\u003e High Engagement\rquadrant-1 We should expand\rquadrant-2 Need to promote\rquadrant-3 Re-evaluate\rquadrant-4 May be improved\rCampaign A: [0.3, 0.6]\rCampaign B: [0.45, 0.23]\rCampaign C: [0.57, 0.69]\rCampaign D: [0.78, 0.34]\rCampaign E: [0.40, 0.34]\rCampaign F: [0.35, 0.78] Quadrant Chart Syntax linkTitle The title is a short description of the chart and it will always render on top of the chart.\nExample quadrantChart title This is a sample example\nx-axis The x-axis determines what text would be displayed in the x-axis. In x-axis there is two part left and right you can pass both or you can pass only left. The statement should start with x-axis then the left axis text followed by the delimiter –\u003e then right axis text. Example x-axis –\u003e both the left and right axis text will be rendered. x-axis only the left axis text will be rendered.\ny-axis The y-axis determines what text would be displayed in the y-axis. In y-axis there is two part top and bottom you can pass both or you can pass only bottom. The statement should start with y-axis then the bottom axis text followed by the delimiter –\u003e then top axis text. Example y-axis –\u003e both the bottom and top axis text will be rendered. y-axis only the bottom axis text will be rendered.\nQuadrants text The quadrant-[1,2,3,4] determine what text would be displayed inside the quadrants. Example quadrant-1 determine what text will be rendered inside the top right quadrant. quadrant-2 determine what text will be rendered inside the top left quadrant. quadrant-3 determine what text will be rendered inside the bottom left quadrant. quadrant-4 determine what text will be rendered inside the bottom right quadrant.\nPoints Points are used to plot a circle inside the quadrantChart. The syntax is : [x, y] here x and y value is in the range 0 - 1. Example Point 1: [0.75, 0.80] here the Point 1 will be drawn in the top right quadrant. Point 2: [0.35, 0.24] here the Point 2 will be drawn in the bottom left quadrant.\ninfo All extra information about Quadrant charts can be found in Quadrant Charts Basic Quadrant Chart linkCode:\n```mermaid\r---\rtitle: Basic Quadrant Chart\r---\rquadrantChart\rx-axis Urgent --\u003e Not Urgent\ry-axis Not Important --\u003e \"Important ❤\"\rquadrant-1 Plan\rquadrant-2 Do\rquadrant-3 Delegate\rquadrant-4 Delete\r```\r---\rtitle: Basic Quadrant Chart\r---\rquadrantChart\rx-axis Urgent --\u003e Not Urgent\ry-axis Not Important --\u003e \"Important ❤\"\rquadrant-1 Plan\rquadrant-2 Do\rquadrant-3 Delegate\rquadrant-4 Delete Class Diagram linkWhat is a Class Diagram linkA class diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that represents the structure of a system by depicting the classes of objects within it, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.\nClass diagrams are used primarily in software engineering and system design to visualize the structure of object-oriented systems. They provide a blueprint for designing software applications, helping developers understand the relationships between different classes, plan the implementation of code, and ensure consistency and clarity in the design process.\n---\rtitle: Animal example\r---\rclassDiagram\rnote \"From Duck till Zebra\"\rAnimal \u003c|-- Duck\rnote for Duck \"can fly\\ncan swim\\ncan dive\\ncan help in debugging\"\rAnimal \u003c|-- Fish\rAnimal \u003c|-- Zebra\rAnimal : +int age\rAnimal : +String gender\rAnimal: +isMammal()\rAnimal: +mate()\rclass Duck{\r+String beakColor\r+swim()\r+quack()\r}\rclass Fish{\r-int sizeInFeet\r-canEat()\r}\rclass Zebra{\r+bool is_wild\r+run()\r} Class Diagram Syntax link UML provides mechanisms to represent class members, such as attributes and methods, and additional information about them. A single instance of a class in the diagram contains three compartments:\nThe top compartment contains the name of the class. It is printed in bold and centered, and the first letter is capitalized. It may also contain optional annotation text describing the nature of the class.\nThe middle compartment contains the attributes of the class. They are left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.\nThe bottom compartment contains the operations the class can execute. They are also left-aligned and the first letter is lowercase.\ninfo All extra information about Quadrant Diagrams can be found in Class Diagram Basic Class Diagram link ```mermaid\r---\rtitle: Bank example\r---\rclassDiagram\rclass BankAccount\rBankAccount : +String owner\rBankAccount : +Bigdecimal balance\rBankAccount : +deposit(amount)\rBankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)\r```\r---\rtitle: Bank example\r---\rclassDiagram\rclass BankAccount\rBankAccount : +String owner\rBankAccount : +Bigdecimal balance\rBankAccount : +deposit(amount)\rBankAccount : +withdrawal(amount) Timeline Diagram linkWhat is a Timeline Diagram linkA Timeline Diagram is a visual representation that displays events, tasks, or milestones along a chronological axis. It typically consists of horizontal bars or lines representing the duration or occurrence of each event, with labels or markers indicating key points in time.\nTimeline diagrams are used to illustrate the sequence of events or activities over a period, providing a clear and concise overview of temporal relationships. They are commonly utilized in project management, historical analysis, storytelling, and process visualization\ntimeline\rtitle England's History Timeline\rsection Stone Age\r7600 BC : Britain's oldest known house was built in Orkney, Scotland\r6000 BC : Sea levels rise and Britain becomes an island.\nThe people who live here are hunter-gatherers.\rsection Bronze Age\r2300 BC : People arrive from Europe and settle in Britain. They bring farming and metalworking.\r: New styles of pottery and ways of burying the dead appear.\r2200 BC : The last major building works are completed at Stonehenge.\nPeople now bury their dead in stone circles.\r: The first metal objects are made in Britain.Some other nice things happen. it is a good time to be alive. Timeline Diagram Synxtax link The syntax for creating Timeline diagram is simple. You always start with the timeline keyword to let mermaid know that you want to create a timeline diagram.\nAfter that there is a possibility to add a title to the timeline. This is done by adding a line with the keyword title followed by the title text.\nThen you add the timeline data, where you always start with a time period, followed by a colon and then the text for the event. Optionally you can add a second colon and then the text for the event. So, you can have one or more events per time period.\ninfo All extra information about Timeline Diagrams can be found in Timeline Diagram Basic Timeline Diagram link ```mermaid\rtimeline\rtitle History of Social Media Platform\r2002 : LinkedIn\r2004 : Facebook : Google\r2005 : Youtube\r2006 : Twitter\r```\rtimeline\rtitle History of Social Media Platform\r2002 : LinkedIn\r2004 : Facebook : Google\r2005 : Youtube\r2006 : Twitter "

This process is simple: just modify the draft variable to false or, alternatively, remove this variable completely. This ensures that the page is ready to publish.\nShowing an example with the Setup page:\n---\rweight: 300\rtitle: \"Setup\"\ricon: \"rocket_launch\"\rdate: \"2024-03-20T18:19:36Z\"\rlastmod: \"2024-03-20T18:19:36Z\"\rdescription: \"A quick start guide to get started in Lotus Doc and how this page was made\"\rdraft: false toc: true\r--- From this moment on, the page will be considered published. This means that when viewing the site preview, it will no longer be necessary to enter the hugo server -D command. Now, you can use the hugo server command to view all published pages, excluding those that are in draft.\nBefore proceeding, it is important to confirm that you have made changes to the first level _index.md file. If you have changed it, make sure the draft variable is set to false. In our example, since we changed the title and the draft is marked as true, we will need to modify this variable as well.\n---\rweight: 999\rtitle: \"New Docs Title\"\rdescription: \"\"\ricon: \"article\"\rdate: \"2024-04-19T16:14:44+01:00\"\rlastmod: \"2024-04-19T16:14:44+01:00\"\rdraft: false\rtoc: true\r--- info Note: If you did not create a _index.md file for the first level because you did not need to modify any information, you do not need to create it to set the draft to false, as this is already the default value if _index.md does not have been created. Showing what the page preview looks like:\nWhen doing hugo server -D: Here you can see that DRAFT has already disappeared from the setup page content, as well as from the document title\nWhen doing hugo server: This is a very important step to later be able to Deployed your document\nLicense linkLotus Docs is distributed under the MIT license, which is an extremely flexible and permissive software license.

Code Fence: linkCode fences significantly enhance the clarity and readability of code snippets within your technical documentation. They ensure that code blocks are presented in a visually distinct and easily scannable format. We employ this technique in section 4 of the “Deployment: GitHub” page to highlight the line containing the draft.\nCode Fences Description linenos configure line numbers. Valid values are true, false, table, or inline. hl_lines lists a set of line numbers or line number ranges to be highlighted. linenostart=1 starts the line number count from 1. anchorlinenos Configure anchors on line numbers. Valid values are true or false. So the following example:\n```toml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[3,\"1-2\"],linenostart=1,anchorlinenos=true}\rbaseURL = 'https://colinwilson.github.io'\rlanguageCode = 'en-us'\rtitle = 'My New Hugo Site'\r``` It will render as:\nbaseURL = 'https://colinwilson.github.io'\rlanguageCode = 'en-us'\rtitle = 'My New Hugo Site' 4. Alerts: linkOn deployment pages, we utilize alerts with an “info” context, like this:\ninfo This is an alert with an info context. {{ \u003c alert context=\"info\" text=\"This is an alert with an info context. It consists of the info theme colour and icon.\" /\u003e}} Additionally, we have other context options available: success, danger, warning, primary, light, and dark.\ncheck_circle This is an alert with an success context. report This is an alert with an danger context. warning This is an alert with an warning context. info This is an alert with an primary context. This is an alert with an light context. This is an alert with an dark context. 5. Links: linkDuring the development of the prerequisites on the two pages, links were utilized to direct users to relevant resources.\nTo create a simple hyperlink to a website, use the following syntax: [Link Text](URL) Replace Link Text with the text you want to display for the link [A GitHub Account](https://github.com/) Final result: A GitHub Account 6.
